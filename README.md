### How it works ⚙️
- Built from scratch with Node, Express and pug template engine on the back end
- The front end uses vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries like React or Vue
- Completely responsive and mobile friendly
- Inspired by a Pug and CSS Workshop video by one of my favourite developers 👉 [@Jhey](https://twitter.com/jh3yy)
- The quotes are from an API shown in this [freecodecamp.org article](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373)
- The snowflake symbols are generated by the embedded [Mandala font](https://www.fontspace.com/mandalas-font-f30143) using the @font-face rule
- Form validation restricts keys to 0-9, a-z and A-Z
